        <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
        <p>
            In today’s competitive world, students often feel lost when selecting courses, colleges, or career paths. 
            There is a lack of personalized, data-driven platforms that help students visualize their future academically and professionally.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our AI-Enhanced Career Guidance System solves this by providing smart, personalized career pathways 
            for students from 10th grade, 12th grade, UG, and PG levels. It uses AI suggestions, real data trends, 
            and user-friendly guidance to bridge the gap between academic decisions and industry needs.
        </p>
